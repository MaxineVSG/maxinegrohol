      p growing up in a few countries has given me many opportunities to travel, learn about different cultures and learn from different people.
      p because of this my photography revolves around the places i have been and the people i meet.
      p my perspective on design has also grown. i have a passion for both print and web design and now strive to learn more about the two through research, experimentation and whoever is willing to teach me!
